## Writer ✍🏻 and Librarian 📚
These are my credentials - a B.A. in Professional Writing and an M.S. in Library and Information Science. Yes, I have skills associated with these credentials and these are my core competencies, but I consider myself a generalist.

## Data 💾
At Syracuse University's iSchool, every professor started each class saying, <mark>'It's all about the data'.</mark> I learned SQL painfully through graduate courses such as database administration and metadata. I started applying these skills in a position where I tested and helped put into production an Oracle database application. I further utilized my SQL skills in testing simulation and optimization applications that required clean, production data. Later, I was responsible for creating MySQL databases and tables, and then loading and troubleshooting customer data.

## DevOps 🏗️
In one role, I was hired as a technical writer. The team, like many, was a lightweight development team where everybody had to do a bit of everything. In my case, I stepped up on DevOps throughout the CI/CD lifecycle under the tutelage of a senior engineering architect. Some of my DevOps tasks were to:
- spin up  pre-packaged servers
- install Docker on pre-packaged servers
- add new GIT repos and Jenkins automation with configured project application code
- set up development applications and Tableau Server in Docker containers
- configure development and production environments
- create application databases and load application data
- onboard teammates and customers
- enforce user management and security/certificate policies
- manage application and Tableau Server licenses
- update scripts to create and push application docker images

## Testing and QA 🧪
As a technical writer, testing and QA is a key part of the profession. Some of my QA responsibilities were to:
- step through application user interfaces 
- review localized versions of user interfaces
- adapt automated test scripts
- write test cases
- clean up code
- query data
