## Background

<p>In a summer between years of college, I packed my car and moved two cities down the interstate to work for the New York Public Interest Research Group (NYPIRG).</p>

<p>In theory, this was the job for me. I could learn about iniatives that I believed in such as protecting the environment, encouraged recycling, etc.</p>

<p>My first day, I was asked to get in front of everyone and do my 'rap'. A 'rap' was the bit you were required to say to people to get them to learn a little about one of the initiatives that we were trying to raise money to support. This was terrifying, but I got up and, probably blacked out, because I don't remember what I said.</p> 

<p>Right after that terrifying moment, I was driven out to a city neighborhood, and I was instructed to go door-to-door and do my 'rap' that I just "learned" like 45 minutes earlier. For whatever reason, this was less terrifying, but door after door I was rejected. I even had one exteremly loney person invite me into their home which was strictly against NYPIRG rules, but this person didn't offer money for the initiative, no, instead I was offered beer.</p> 

<p>What I realized was that I hated making conversation with people knowing that I was also going to ask for money. I wasn't convincing, I'm sure, because I didn't believe in what I was doing. I believed in the information that came before the asking for the money, but the asking for money bit sank my entire personality.</p>

<p>You may be asking yourself, if you're even still reading this, what's the point?</p> 

## New need to ask for money

<p>Well, I've avoided putting myself in any position where I have had to ask for money in this way. That is until August 2023 when my sister asked me to run a half marathon on a charity bib. Under most circumstances, I would've rejected my sister's request, but since we live across the country from each other, I couldn't refuse because doing the race was coupled with her taking a trip to see me.</p>

<p>In short, I had to find a charity associated with the half marathon, sign up with a committment to raise $520, and, after three months, start asking for money. The charity that I selected was Parent Project Muscular Dystrophy (PPMD), which at the time, I knew nothing about. So how was I supposed to ask for money without knowing much about about the charity? </p>

## New money asking strategy

<p>After thinking about how I could possibly ask for money, I decided to use the full transparency method. My one footing was that I started a 12-week training program in October 2023. So, I posted on LinkedIn asking for contributions, but I had also provided a link to my Strava profile so people could check my activities, I linked to my fundraising page, which contained additional training information. My LinkedIn posts generated about $75, which was good and a step in the right direction for me.</p> 

## Asking for money faux pas

<p>I absolutely didn't want to ask for money at work, but my company has a corporate matching policy, where donations up to $500 are matched dollar for dollar. I decided to email my work department and use the corporate matching policy as a way to ask for a contribution. Drafing this email felt very uncomfortable, so I decided to keep the details tight and even offer for people to donate to other charities; however, my mistake was not anticipating that people in my department knew me, were interested in what my charity is about, then started reaching out and donating while thinking that I had muscular dystrophy. I was able to raise the rest of my money, but with the unfortunate task of having to explain that I also didn't have muscular dystrophy a couple of times. When I came up with my LinkedIn post, I decided on full transparancy, but my email to my department didn't meet those standards and it caused confusion. </p>

## The lesson

<p>I'm still not good at asking for money, but I think that I'm on to something with the full transparancy thing. By showing my humanity, which in this case was displaying all my body busting training activities, people could appreciate that I was also putting effort into the thing that I was asking money for. And it doesn't make me feel so bad.</p>
