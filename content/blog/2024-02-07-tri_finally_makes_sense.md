## Path to triathlon

<p>My tri story takes us back to my freshman year in college when I was starting to realize the gapping hole in my life. I had just wrapped a varsity career where I lettered five years in track and field, four years in soccer, and three years in basketball while setting school records in each sport.</p>

<p>When I arrived to my college campus, I was immediately lost mentally, spiritually, and physically. At first, I got in with guys who lifted. My first semester I gained about 25-30 lbs. Some of that was much needed muscle but much of it was fat from overeating plus my new sedentary college experience.</p> 

<p>Although I played intramural sports and flirted with college sports, I wasn‚Äôt interested in the formality and commitment of it all. I decided to focus on lifetime sports and thus began my path to triathlon. </p>

<p>I competed my first triathlon (sprint) at the end of my freshman year of college. I made many mistakes and then also repeat some of them. Back in 2005/2006, sport watches were available but not really affordable. I actually wouldn‚Äôt invest in one until 2018. For my teenage years and my 20s, I‚Äôd train by listening to my body instead of following a coaches advice or other conventional wisdom. I definitely read books on the subject, but some of the simplicity of the sport was alluding me.</p> 

<p>The vast majority of my workouts were at 80% of max effort or above. I rarely was training easy miles or what I‚Äôd now call zone 2. For running, these high effort workouts, at the time, seemed to work for me. I could bust out 7 minute miles for as long as 10 miles. Spoiler alert, I currently cannot reach these numbers in 2024.</p> 

<p>For cycling, I was mainly using indoor gym bikes or I had some crappy Walmart hybrid bike. The main cycling training metric that I‚Äôd look at is speed. I know. I was pretty much a caveman. </p>

<p>Oh, and don‚Äôt get me started on swim. While I tend to have natural athletic abilities, swim is not one of them. For my first tri, I had barely trained for swim and this was the first of many grave mistakes. </p>

<p>The other grave mistakes were that I didn‚Äôt have a road bike and I didn‚Äôt fuel at all during the race, which for a sprint is probably okay for some people. </p>

## Tri for the Y

<p>The primary problem that I had was hubris. Young and dumb. I thought that I was the shit and that I was going to compete. Don‚Äôt forget I lettered three times in three different high school varsity sports (ha!). In my first triathlon, the competing bit went out the window as soon as I started my wave in the pool as I flopped, gasped, and sputtered for 400 meters. </p>

<p>Next, I mounted my old, out-of-tune, Walmart bike. A few people slowed down to say some crappy thing that basically translated to, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre so brave for riding that junker.‚Äù</p>

<p>Last, my bread and butter, running. I don‚Äôt think that I had done very many bricks that prepared me for this transition. Ouch. When I finished, I was determined. Determined to come back next year and destroy my ghost.</p>

<p>Although training started immediately, I couldn't help myself and I signed up for another sprint a few months later. Again, in my aforementioned hubris, I thought that I could improve considerably.</p>

## West Point Triathlon

<p>This time I was able to borrow a friend's old steel road bike. I had one tri under my belt. And I ws going to kick some major Army ass. One element that I vastly underestimated was the open-water swim. I struggled mightily in a pool swim lane, and open water was much worse. I was utterly demolished. I finished 528/547. I was slapped and hit and swallowed loads of water. At one point I gave up and did some backstroke. At least 2-3 waves behind me were catching up and passing me. I was demoralized, but I crawled out of the lake and kept going.</p>

<p>My first transition was also a disaster, but I got on the bike and did a lot better than the swim. I blazed through my second transition and actually kicked a little butt on the run. Overall, I did NOT kick major Army ass. ü§°

## Train, Train, Train

<p>For the next ten or so months, I continued the grind. Each day. Each week. I did more. And more. And more. I read triathlon books. I talked to other triathletes. I ran in subzero temperatures. I started doing bricks where pool water was dripping out of my nose during my indoor bike ride because I didn't yet know how to breathe out of my nose while swimming. One thing that is common across this era of my athletic history is that I was poor. I didn't have access to some of the tools that are ubiquitous today including a road bike. But still, I persisted on indoor bikes, college meals, swimming pools, and a good pair of running shoes.</p>

<p>I improved. I improved a lot, but I didn't know it. There was no Strava. I didn't have a spreadsheet to track at least my times and distances. Nothing. I was training almost entirely on feeling and a general awareness of incrementalism.</p>

## Tri for the Y 2

<p>Leading up to the first anniversary of my first triathlon, I was finding a road bike to use and putting the finishing touches on an effective and consuming training plan. I made one fatal mistake. Being human and having friends. My freshman roommate was a few days away from leaving for the summer and transferring to a school far away. A bunch of us got together, drank vodka, and ate Pizza Hut. You might know where this is going.</p>

<p>When I got up on the day of the race, I was nervous. I figured that I'd improve but I had put so much thought and energy into training that I couldn't get over my myopic drive for competition. My stomach felt off. As soon as I arrived at the venue I had to visit the bathroom. Then again. Then again. Then several more times before my pool wave/race started.</p>

<p>In the pool, I felt incredible. Not Katie Ledecky incredible, but, relative to the previous year, I was a different person.</p>

<p>I got out of the pool feeling great, got on my borrowed road bike, and tore up the road. I pushed so hard that when I got to my transition, I forgot to take off my helmet and started running with it on. There were some snickers, but I was on a mission. I ran the course confidently, but good ol' vokda and pizza came back with a vengeance. I had to pull off in the last mile and dive into some trees. When I crossed the finish line, I had taken something like 15-20 minutes off of my previous time.</p>

## The next 17 years
<p>The summer after Tri for the Y 2 I bought my first road bike. I was hooked after the adrenaline pumping performance/finish. I kept the training up with the intention to continue, but life happened. I studied abroad. I had a semester of depression. I graduated college and struggled to transition to a new city for graduate school. And so on. I did get a lot more into road cycling, but my best pillar, running, withered.</p>

<p>Finally, after grad school, I moved to a new city, started my first job, and realized how out of shape I was and decided to go for it once again. This time I signed up for an Olympic distance. I got an LA Fitness membership for the pool and I had wonderful weather for running and cycling outside. I put in a decent amount of effort, but my performance and motivation never reached those levels during my college years. In the end, my friend came into town last minute for work, we partied, and I missed the race.</p>

## Everything coming together for Ironman 70.3
<p>I honestly thought I'd never come near another triathlon again let alone a 70.3. Here's what happened. For the last decade of my life, I've been mainly a cyclist. I love it. I love the culture. I love the gear. I love all the little tools and data tracking. I love Zwift. Last year, I completed my second century ride and rode the Santa Barbara 100K. As the 100K approached, my sister offered to take a trip to see me if we could run the Disneyland half marathon together. The day after my 100K, I started a 12-week training program through Coros. But I'm getting ahead of myself. Immediately after my sister asked me to do the half marathon, my cousin asked me to do a 70.3 with him. He had just completed one and wanted me to join him in another</p>

<p>Everything was coming together. I was already in bike shape. I was about to complete a 12-week Coros running program to do the half marathon. Then I'd be in run shape. All I had to do was layer in the swimming, which would be, by far, the longest competitive swim of my life. So, I said yes to it all.</p>

<p>I'm better at cycling than I've ever been, but my running is far from my days of glory. I'm about 1 minute/mile slower on my long runs. I haven't done laps in the pool for 12 years. üò≥</p>

<p>What's different now is that I've lived a life. My ligaments are crappier. I'm heavier. But my resources have increased. Fitness technology has come a long way in 17 years. I'm now mid-career with mid-career money. I have two road bikes including a race bike and a Wahoo Kickr bike. I have a Coros Apex 2 fitness watch. You get the point. But again, I'm more out of shape, heavier, and past my explosive prime and into my endurance prime.</p>

<p>I'm also smarter. For my 100K bike race, I completed a Wahoo SYSTM gran fondo plan, which assessed my fitness before and after. For my half marathon, I completed a Coros intermediate half marathon plan. I've built my endurance sustainably for the first time in my life. What's also different is that the access to information is so much better. On YouTube alone, I have dozens of swim coaches. I'm in the optimization phase and it's fun. In college, it was the competitive phase, but the optimization phase is about trying new things. Now, I'm fueling. I'm looking at power data, lap times, and form. I had never considered using aero bars or even a triathlon bike, but now my Wahoo Kickr bike is outfitted with aero bars that I bought on Amazon.</p>

<p>It's the perfect time in my life since I have the patience, resources, and energy to look at every aspect of triathlon and consider it. And therein lies the beauty of triathlon. Mixing three disciplines means that each little adjustment throughout a 70.3 can make a huge difference. It's weird. I've totally skipped the Olympic distance, but doing the 70.3 is somehow the logical decision for me and a helluva way to end my fling with triathlon.</p>
