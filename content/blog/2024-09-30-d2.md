## Context
After Mermaid, I was hoping for something better from a diagrams-as-code perspective. I think that I've come across something that will become better ... D2. 

## Why
D2 seems to have some more flexibility and extensibility that Mermaid is lacking. For instance, in my Mermaid code, the syntax is more simplistic. D2 allows for more specific instructions.

### Examples
#### Mermaid
```
erDiagram

    bicycles{
        bicycle_id SERIAL PK
        make varchar(50)
        model varchar(50)
        groupset varchar(50)
        frame_type varchar(50)
        frame_size varchar(50)
        prime_color varchar(50)
        model_year int
        crank_length varchar(50)
    }
```

#### D2
```
bicycles: {
  shape: sql_table
  bicycle_id: SERIAL {constraint: primary_key}
  make: varchar(50)
  model: varchar(50)
  groupset: varchar(50)
  frame_type: varchar(50)
  frame_size: varchar(50)
  prime_color: varchar(50)
  model_year: int
  crank_length: varchar(50)
}
```
## But
Right now, Hugo doesn't support D2. So, I cannot embed D2 diagrams into my website as easily as Mermaid or other diagrams-as-code options. I think support will come soon since D2 seems to have the right stuff to emerge as a top tool.
