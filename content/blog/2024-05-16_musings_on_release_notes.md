## There isn't a release notes class

In college, my professional writing program didn't include a class on release notes. Why would it? I'm sure this is not uncommon in a lot of technical communication programs. Perhaps release notes are a subject of a class, but how often are release notes the entire class? In our professional lives, we face many expectations not covered in our academic experiences. Don't get me wrong I've seen books on the subject and Udemy and YouTube content extolling some release guidelines, but it's not exactly a discipline of its own.

## Initial lessons

The first time that I was asked to prepare release notes, the project was technically on its first release. The first release shouldn't need release notes, right? In this case, there had been some pre-releases, demos, and walkthroughs, so I was expected to communicate what had changed since the last time the customer had any touchpoints. I researched and found some guidance that made sense to me, which was to use concise sentences that start with a verb that connotes what happenedâ€”for instance, fixed, added, or enhanced.

## Intermediate lessons

For a time, my initial lessons worked well for me, especially for fixes. Eventually, my initial lessons started to show cracks with new features and enhancements. The problem was if I started an enhancement with "Enhanced...", then I created these long meandering sentence monstrosities. My rules were too rigid. 

I started to make modifications. Each entry would start with something like these: "You can now..." or "Administrators can now...".

## Latest lessons

As with most things in life, my biggest learnings came after I started listening to my more senior writers. I had inherited some release note patterns that I was simply repeating thoughtlessly, but some senior writers pointed out a few things that changed how I view release notes.

- Don't include the release number in the release notes topic (it's already in another part of the doc).
- Don't include the product name in the release notes topic (it's already the header and doc title).
- Don't include content about previous or future releases. The release notes are specifically for this release of the product. For instance, don't codify that some change is coming in the next release or in future version x. 

If anything, this post is about the virtues of listening and collaboration. That's it for now. I'll post again when I evolve to level 7 release notesatarian.
