At work, we're in the throes of identifying our doc toolchain for docs-as-code. We've used DITA well before my time at the company, so this is quite a lift for all of us. 

At first, we thought the toolchain selection would be simple because we started using [Backstage](https://backstage.io) for internal docs, which relies on MkDocs. But MkDocs' age and limitations became apparent especially compared to other generators like Hugo. 

For the last year, we dove deep into MkDocs and could solve virtually any problem with the vast library of plugins. Then our plans hit the reality of our product architecture requirements, tokenized UX, and the need for dynamism and performance in doc building.

Alternative top choices are Docusaurus and Hugo; however, the other day when I was looking at the documentation for the MkDocs Material theme, I saw that the material team is working on a next gen generator called [Zensical](https://zensical.org).

I can't tell if I have big eyes 👀 or if this will be the real deal. What's great about MkDocs is that it's for ... docs. Hugo is great and everything, but it's not doc centric unless you find a doc centric theme. I can't speak for Docusaurus although its toolchain definitely seems more flexible and modernized than MkDocs. But that's the thing, Zensical promises to take the great parts of MkDocs, fill the gaps for the not so great parts, but then still go beyond all that while maintaining compatibility with MkDocs + Material.

> Zensical is designed for seamless compatibility with Material for MkDocs. In many cases, you can install Zensical and build your projects immediately – no changes to configuration or content.
>
> However, Zensical is more than just compatible – it's a complete replacement for both MkDocs and Material for MkDocs. While Material for MkDocs is built on top of MkDocs as a theme and framework, Zensical consolidates both projects into one coherent stack, covering static site generation, theming, and customization.

One thing my localization manager pointed out during our toolchain evaluation is that python-based markdown is not great for porting Markdown and is not as great for i18n and l20n workflows as CommonMark. Zensical has an opinion on this:

> Key goals
>
> Identical Markdown dialect – Zensical uses Python Markdown and Python Markdown Extensions to provide the same dialect that MkDocs uses, ensuring compatibility of your existing content. While this requires Python interop for Markdown rendering (rather than native Rust), it enables seamless migration from Material for MkDocs without any content changes.
>
> We view this as a pragmatic bridge solution that prioritizes immediate usability, and currently explore switching to CommonMark in the near future. Of course, switching will be seamless for users, as we will provide automatic translation between both dialects.

Since the vision and architecture of our product UX is based on microfrontends and dynamic content build and serve, this was music to my ears as well:

> Module system
>
> It's modules all the way down - We aim to build Zensical entirely from composable modules that implement functionality against a simple API, making every part of the build pipeline customizable, extensible, and even replaceable. Modules define the structure of the task graph through a stream-like API, stitching together a coherent build pipeline.

Maybe I'm overreacting but I think for the first time in my life I'm living at the confluence of the exact emergence of tech that I need to solve a specific set of problems at the right time.

I like that the Zensical team is 
militant in proclaiming: `Open Source. Free forever.`

I like the audaciousness and ambition. I want to be a part of that. Sure, maybe I'm a shill, but I'm a free shill. 

Even if Zensical is slow to realize their ambitions, their toolchain is virtually compatible with MkDocs and Material, so the risk of jumping onto this toolchain in alpha is low and we can ride the rise up to a fully realized, modern doc generator.

Am I crazy? I wonder what my teammates will think. I looked at some tech writing communities and nobody else was really hyping but it is generating some chatter.

I think that I'll convert my MkDocs portfolio site to Zensical and see where I can go with it at work.
