Bicycles are miracle machines. They are simple. They are efficient. They are small.  

As a kid, I started on a bicycle with training wheels, then had a tricycle, then skinned my knees falling off a regular bicycle. I explored neighborhoods. I saw friends. I made it home before dinner. 

As a teenager, I had a budget bicycle that I used mostly for exercise. I climbed hills. I adventured to nearby cities. I completed triathlons. 

As a young adult, I purchased a bicycle for the first time. I commuted to work. I finished group rides. I ran errands. 

Now, I have many bicycles. I climb mountains. I tour cities. I stay fit. 

With ebikes, there are virtually no limits on how bicycles can transform human mobility, environmental impact, and communities. Of course, I don't advocate for people to bicycle to work in subzero temperatures with two feet of snow on the ground. Of course, I don't expect farmers or contractors to haul crops or sheet rock on ebikes. However, there is an opportunity for many of us to go from a three car family to a two car family. There is an opportunity for many of us to wrest back healthy habits from sedentary jobs/careers/lifestyles. There is an opportunity for many of us to make our community centers accessible to the young and elderly. On the other hand, there is an opportunity to uplift communities without transportation options. Bicycles can solve problems across all social and economic rungs. 

Like any worthy cause, there are obstacles. People may feel judged with thoughts articulated in this post. Lobbies and monied interests. Cultural notions of convenience and transportation.

The truth is that transportation and mobility are an evolving tapestry. I don't think any segment of the tapestry should go away, but we can rebalance the tapestry.
