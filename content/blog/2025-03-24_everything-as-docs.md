## Update
Busy is one word to describe the last few months, so there's a lot to say. 

## Libraries
Librarians and documentarians have a shared value set centered on education. An opportunity arose recently for me to learn about what ambitious libraries are up to today. And as a librarian, the technology tooling for librarians and documentarians are heading in a similar direction...open source. I could speculate that the financial and budgetary pressures on libraries and doc teams have forced this direction, but I fear that's too simplistic. I think libraries are heading in this direction because there's more potential, integration, support, and scalability. With more autonomy, the mission of advancing education goals becomes easier. Open source helps librarians stay nimble and address the uniqueness of their community. 

For documentarians, open source tooling makes for an easier experience leveraging the doc toolchain for engineering efficiencies and enhancements. My company is planning a transition to a fully enforced GitOps model. Currently, my doc team is violating just about every tenant of the GitOps model. Some of my teammates are struggling with what this means. Often, I don't know what this transition means. 

Transitions are hard. They are scary. They are challenging. 

## Experimentation and Curiousity
For any transition, a mindset of experimentation and curiousity is helpful. I've felt some of the tension and stress of librarians and my teammates who have experienced a big transition or who face a transition. Personally, I feel uncertainty, which I address with experimentation and curiousity. I tinker. I test. I play. I feel most fulfilled at work when I'm figuring stuff out and problem solving. 

For those who are stressed by a transition, I think the root cause is a lack of feature parity from before the transition to after. Something will be missing and therefore it causes discomfort. I can empathize with that feeling but I can also understand the transition should be for a reason. 

The reason my company wants to adopt a GitOps model is to speed up development, reduce redundancies, and grant developers access to the source content. Currently, our source content is stored in a content management system that only writers can access. Our developers cannot contribute unless we take several manual steps to provide them output. 

Although understanding what will be missing or different is important, I focus on the reason for changing. In my company's case, the reason is to be better at software development. So, I'm willing to experiment and approach change with curiousity. 

One of our UX colleagues recently presented to my doc team. He talked about disrupting yourself in order to continuing learning and growing. This was an uncomfortable experience because implicitly he and others are anticipating that we'll resist the transition. They are right. Folks on my doc team resist some of the tenants and edicts of the GitOps model. Since I like new things, I find myself in a middle where I'm trying new stuff and giving myself over to change but my teammates are directing their resistance through me to the architects of the transition. I'm just the guy who likes new stuff, ya know? But I've also learned more about my work archetypes. I'm an early adopter. 

## tools, Tools, TOOLS
A tool is just a thing that helps with something. Here are some things that helped me recently: 
- Git submodules
- Figma
- Backstage
- Python

I plan to write some posts about these learnings
