## Update

Triathlon training is in full swing. I'm running 30+ mile, cycling 100+ mile, and swimming 2-3 mile weeks. I've found interesting nuances of training unique to triathlon. For instance, I didn't know that being in the time trial bike position made it easier to throw up a little into your mouth. I find this happens on my longer rides where I have to hydrate and take big gulps of beverage. The liquid sloshes in the stomach area for a while before intermittently ending up back in my mouth for a split second.

Another experience that I'm having is extreme fatigue. There were moments/days when I felt light-headed and extremely lethargic. So, I increased my calorie intake to address that. I'm not a great calorie counter and never have been, so that's an area that I lack knowledge. 

My running ability is increasing. I'm noticing on my longer runs that I can push harder for longer. I started running more about six months ago. Most of those six months were spent just getting the mileage down, but in the last few months, my performance has improved. 

I'm starting to plateau in swimming. I started swimming three months ago at a community aquatic center. I could swim about 2:50s / 100yd. I have that down to about 2:15s / 100yd, but I haven't improved in the last month. I also noticed that I started tanning since the aquatic center is outdoors. I must benefit from sun exposure, but now I have to thoroughly sunscreen since I'm cheap and don't want to purchase more swim gear. 

Cycling is my wildcard. I had trained for a 100K bike race, which I completed six months ago. My fitness on the bike was very high. I was inconsistent for a few months but started picking up bike volume again two months back. In race simulations, my performance seems too good to be true. Also, I have never used a triathlon bike before. I have an indoor bike with added aero bars to simulate, but I have no idea how to corner on a tri bike on real roads.

I tried switching from a hydration mix to a hydration tablet. This did not go well. The hydration tablet resulted in painful gastro cramps. This sounds dramatic but my run and bike nutrition choices are going well otherwise. I landed on an 80g SiS Beta energy drink mix and 46g SiS Beta chews, and I'll switch back to the Skratch hydration mix. 

Mentally, I've tamed my competitive spirit to accept that I'm not a pro. I will not buy all the expensive equipment and gear for a single triathlon. As a result, I've decided to change all gear during each transition. I'll bring towels in my transition bags to change with and maximize comfort on the bike and for the run. My race goal is to have fun while attempting to push myself beyond my previous bounds.
