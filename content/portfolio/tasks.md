## Install tires with tubes

### Prerequisites

You will need:
- Compatibles clincher tires (2)
- Compatible tubes (2)

### Steps

Repeat per wheel.
1. Remove any tube valve stem nut or valve cap, if applicable.
2. Add several pumps of air into the tube with the bicycle pump until the tube starts to
take shape.

    > **NOTE**    
    > The several pumps of air stiffens the tube and makes the tube easier to place and stay inside the tire during tire installation.

3. Hold the tire horizontally and push the minimally inflated tube inside the tire.
4. Reference the tire sidewall for any wheel rotation direction information and align the
tire accordingly, if applicable.
5. Insert the tube's valve stem into the rim's valve hole while holding the tube in place.
6. Tuck one side of the tire bead into the rim starting from the valve stem.
7. Tuck the other side of the tire bead into the rim starting from the valve stem.

    > **NOTE**    
    > Expect increased resistance while tucking the second tire bead and use tire levers to gain leverage at tight points. Do not pinch the tube.

1. Check both sides of the tire to make sure the bead is tucked evenly while also ensuring
the tube is not pinched.
1. Reference the pressure ranges listed on the tire to determine the appropriate tire pressure.
1. Inflate the tire partially with the bicycle pump while inspecting that the bead seats
properly.

    > **TIP**    
    > For bead seating trouble, deflate, adjust bead and rim, reinflate, check, and repeat as necessary.

1. Inflate the tire to the full tire pressure within the manufacturer's range.
1. Install any tube valve stem nut or valve cap, if applicable.

The wheels are ready to install on your bicycle. Reference the bicycle installation instructions.

## Install tubeless tires

### Prerequisites

You will need:
- Compatibles tubeless tires (2)
- Bicycle pump with gauge and compatible head for tubeless valve type
- Tire levels
- Sealant (30-60 ml / 1-2 ounces)
- Tubeless tape (23 mm)
- Clean cloth
- Pocket knife or scissors
- Tubeless valves (2)
- Valve core tool
- Degreasing agent

### Steps

Repeat per wheel.
1. Prepare the rim bed for tubeless rim tape and wipe the rim bed with the cloth and
degreasing agent.
2. Apply the tubeless tape to the rim bed starting between the first and second spoke
hole next to the valve hole, then over the valve hole, and then completely around the
rim bed with about a 12 cm / 5 in. overlap.

    > **TIP**    
    > The inner wheel width is 20 mm, so the tape needs a width of 2-3 mm more to adequately create the seal.
3. Make a hole in the tape with a small knife or scissors through the valve hole large
enough to accommodate the tubeless valve.
4. Install the tubeless valve.
1. Remove the tubeless valve nut and valve cap.
2. Insert the valve through the valve hole through the taped side of the rim.
3. Reinstall and tighten the valve nut.
5. Reference the pressure ranges listed on the tire to determine the appropriate tire pressure.
6. Reference the tire sidewall for any wheel rotation direction information and align the
tire accordingly, if applicable.
7. Tuck one side of the tire bead into the rim starting from the valve stem.
8. Select a method for adding sealant.

|  **Sealant Method** | **Steps**  |
| - | - |
| **Valve** |<ol><li>Tuck the other side of the tire bead into the rim starting from the valve stem. <p>**NOTE** <br>Expect increased resistance while tucking the second tire bead and use tire levers to gain leverage at tight points.</p></li><li>Inflate the tire until the tire is seated.</li><li>Deflate the tire.</li><li>Remove the valve core with a valve core tool.</li><li>Add sealant through the value core with a pump or squeeze through a bag.</li><li>Install the valve core with a valve core tool.</li><li>Inflate the tire.</li></ol>|
| **Tire** |<ol><li>Tuck the other side of the tire bead into the rim starting from the opposite end of the valve stem, but stop for the last quarter centered at the valve stem.</li><li>Hold the wheel upright, pull the quarter untucked tire at the valve stem and pour 30-60 ml / 1-2 ounces of sealant into the tire</li><li>Rotate the tire slowly until the valve stem is at the top of the wheel while holding the wheel upright.</li><li>Finish tucking the remaining tire bead into the rim.<p>**NOTE**<br> Expect increased resistance while tucking the second tire bead and use tire levers to gain leverage at tight points.</p></li><li>Inflate the tire until the tire is seated.</li></ol>|
<p>

9. Install the valve cap.
10. Rotate the wheels around slowly with some side-to-side tilt to coat the inside of the
tire with sealant.

    > **TIP**    
    > For best results, ensure the wheels spin for five to ten minutes for the next few days to distribute the sealant.

The wheels are ready to install on your bicycle. Reference your bicycle installation instructions.
