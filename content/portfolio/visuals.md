## Style Demo

As a style committee member, we overhauled our style guide. In an effort to demonstrate some of the capitalization rules, I provided the rules in context of our UX with [Figma](https://www.figma.com).

## Relationship Diagram

A software application that I was documenting had an adjuster package that would adjust calculated values. The adjuster package has sets, rules, and qualifiers. I needed a way to depict the relationship between these three components of the adjuster package in order for users to grasp how to configure the adjusters. For instance, a set may have more than one rule but a rule can only have one qualifier. Another insight communicated in the diagram is that qualifiers do not need to be associated with a rule because a qualifier may have expired or is planned for the future.

## Document Workflow Diagram
As a new hire, I wanted to understand how my small software development team and I would produce user documentation. After a few months on the job, I was able to grasp the role that I needed to play but also the role that teammates would need to play in the user documentation life cycle. This workflow is what I presented to clear up any confusion about who does what, how user documentation is authored, the format of review documents, and how comments are documented.

### Software upgrade by Environment Workflow Diagram
I worked a project that had a software application with two forms including a forecast program and a real-time processing program. These two form factors shared a lot of code and resources since they essentially performed the same function except the forecast program processed historical data and the real-time program processed new, incoming data. Within these two programs, each had its own sub-environments. A need arose from developers to understand how software upgrades would happen, where would they originate, what were the high-level steps, what to do if testing failed, etc. This workflow diagram accompanied a text description in a workflow document for the software.
