I have three Microsoft Word templates available for sharing. The first two I am sharing as PDFs. Why PDF, you say? Well, these are my works and if you like what you see then you can ask me about them. The first two are templates. These two were created recently and are posted in a generic format while the third template was created several years ago for a position in higher education.
1. This template is used for technical documents such as design or architecture docs: [Doc Template 1](./doc_template_1.pdf).
2. This template is used for reports or requests: [Doc Template 2](./doc_template_2.pdf).
3. This template is a signature page form for students to plug into their theses or dissertations: [Doc Template 3](./doc_template_3.doc).
